=Known Limitations
â€”- Requires DeflV and Zsnsr as inputs. 


=Previous Limitations (Not long apply as of date in paren)
-- (10/6/15) Requires a dwell of more than 1 point on the surface. This could be fixed by short-circuiting the line-fitting if there isn't a dwell (on the 'after'/'before' touchoff curves in the approach/retract involvs calculating). My guess is that FitFunc will crash if this is attempted now, although I haven't tested this.
